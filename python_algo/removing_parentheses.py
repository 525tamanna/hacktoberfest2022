Removing Parentheses
Algorithms level Medium

Given a string of parentheses s, return the minimum number of parentheses to be removed to make the string balanced.

Balanced = Containing no unmatched brackets.
For example, "(())" is balanced, while "(()))" is not.

Constraints
n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s


Example 1:
  Input: s = "()())()"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: We can remove the ")" at index 4 to make it balanced.

Example 2
  Input: s = ")("
  Output: 2
  Explanation: We must remove all the parentheses.
